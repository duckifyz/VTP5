VTP5
====

This program is made to replace the ancient VTP4 program used in the Reading School Classics Department. The old program was ugly, hard to use and laked many features. Our aim is to simplify the user experience by changing the UI, making life aesier when inputting and adding leaderboards and other tools. We are planning on making an Android app later if the computer version works well.
