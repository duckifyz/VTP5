VTP5
====

This program is made to replace the VTP4 program used in the Reading School Classics Department. The old program was loved for its simplicity, but it could be hard to use and lacked some much-craved features. Our aim is to simplify the user experience by changing the UI, making life easier when inputting, allowing for different filetypes and adding leaderboards and other tools. We are planning on making an Android app later if the computer version works well.
